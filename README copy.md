## Fundamentals

Starting today, there will be a fundamentals section in each workshop. These are optional but **_HIGHLY_** recommended!

They are a bit more challenging but will sharpen your JS skills!

## ⚡ Exercises

## [Exercise 1](./workshop/exercise-1/) - Creating DOM Nodes

> PS: The picture is very zoomed out just to give you an idea of what the full site looks like.

In this exercise, we'll see how to create web pages using Javascript alone!

In the exercise-1 folder, there are the following files.

- `example.html` (READ ONLY) This is the file that contains the HTML of a short webpage.
- `styles.css` (READ ONLY) Some styles that are used in `example.html`
- `exercise.html` (READ ONLY) This is the HTML file in which you will use JavaScript to recreate the HTML content from `example.html`
- `scripts.js` This is where you will write the JS required to inject all of the HTML into `exercise.html`
- `assets` Some images used in the example

Create the content of a webpage entirely with Javascript.

1. Recreate the content structure from `example.html`.
2. To do this, **you are not allowed to modify any of the HTML files**, only `scripts.js` should be modified.
3. Once you've completed this, compare `example.html` and your `exercise.html` file using "Live Preview", you will notice that they look nothing alike.
4. Add code to the `scripts.js` that will add a `<link>` to the `styles.css` in the `<head>` of `exercise.html`.

In other words: We'll start by recreating the HTML structure, without worrying about the styles. Once the HTML is correct, we'll add a `<link>` tag, which will add the relevant styles.

### How do I do this?

You'll need to make extensive use of `document.createElement`!
